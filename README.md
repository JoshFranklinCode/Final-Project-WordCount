# Final-Project-WordCount
Main .java file will launch a GUI in which the user can enter the website: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1065/1065-h/1065-h.htm
Doing so will return the top 20 word occurences found in The Raven poem and create an SQL table, storing and reading all the words
found previously in alphabetical order.
